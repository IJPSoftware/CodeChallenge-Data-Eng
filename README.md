# Computer Vision and Image Manipulation Interview Questions
## Theoretical Questions

1. Explain the difference between object detection and image classification.

2. What is transfer learning, and how can it be useful in object detection tasks?

3. Describe the architecture of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and its advantages in real-time object detection.

4. What is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and how could it be used in image manipulation tasks?

## Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Object Detection
Implement a function that uses a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to detect and locate a cat in an image.

### Challenge 2: Image Manipulation
Create a function that replaces a detected cat with a pre-defined dog image.

### Challenge 3: End-to-End Pipeline
Combine object detection and image manipulation to create a function that detects a cat in an image and replaces it with a dog.

## Evaluation Criteria
Candidates will be evaluated based on:
1. Understanding of computer vision concepts
2. Ability to work with pre-trained models
3. Code quality and efficiency
4. Problem-solving approach
5. Ability to integrate multiple components into a cohesive solution
